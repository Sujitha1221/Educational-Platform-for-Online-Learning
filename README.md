# Development of an Educational Platform for Online Learning
----------------------------------------------------------

### Description
The objective of this project is to build a robust RESTful API using Express.js, a popular Node.js framework, and MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for managing courses, users, payment enrolment, utilizing SMS and email, and other related data. The API will implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data.

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: Vite + React (with functional components)
- Language: JavaScript
- CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Separate REST APIs for user management, course management, payment management and enrolment management

### Setup Instructions
1. Cloning the Repository 
Ensure Git is installed on your local machine. If not, download and install it from Git's official website.
Open a terminal or command prompt on the computer.
Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project files using the 'cd' command.
Once you're in the desired directory, you can clone the project repository using the following command:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Y3S1-GRP22/Educational-Platform-for-Online-Learning
```

Press Enter to execute the command. Git will download all the files from the repository and create a local copy in the directory you specified.

2. Start Docker Compose
- Open the project using Visual Studio code.
- Open the docker desktop.
- Open the main folder of the project in the terminal.
- write the command as below and click the enter button.

```bash
  docker-compose up --build
```

- This command will install dependencies, create Docker images, and start the services and frontend on the respective ports.

3. Access the Application
- Once all images are successfully created, you can access the student frontend at the following port:
```bash
  localhost:4000
```

and you can access the admin/instructor frontend at the following port
```bash
  localhost:3000
```
